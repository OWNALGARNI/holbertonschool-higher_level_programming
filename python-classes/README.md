Project Tasks

0. My first square
- Create an empty class `Square`
- Learn the basic structure of a Python class

1. Square with size
- Add a private instance attribute `__size`
- Initialize the square with a given size (no validation yet)

2. Size validation
- Validate that `size` is an integer
- Raise a `TypeError` if `size` is not an integer
- Raise a `ValueError` if `size` is less than 0

3. Area of a square
- Add a method `area()` that returns the area of the square

4. Access and update private attribute
- Use properties to safely get and set the value of `size`
- Add validation inside the setter

5. Printing a square
- Implement a method to print the square using `#`
- Handle edge cases such as size 0

6. Coordinates of a square
- Add a `position` attribute
- Print the square with respect to its coordinates
