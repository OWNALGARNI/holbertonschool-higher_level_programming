## Tasks

### 0. Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses
Defines an abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `sound`.
Subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` implement the `sound` method.

**File:** `task_00_abc.py`

---

### 1. Shapes, Interfaces, and Duck Typing
Demonstrates the use of interfaces and duck typing by defining shape-like
objects that share common behavior without relying on explicit inheritance.

**File:** `task_01_shapes.py`

---

### 2. Extending the Python List with Notifications
Shows how to extend a built-in Python class (`list`) to add custom behavior
while preserving existing functionality.

**File:** `task_02_notifications.py`

---

### 3. CountedIterator - Keeping Track of Iteration
Implements a custom iterator that counts how many elements have been iterated
over, demonstrating iterator protocols and state tracking.

**File:** `task_03_counted_iterator.py`

---

### 4. The Enigmatic FlyingFish - Exploring Multiple Inheritance
Explores multiple inheritance by combining behaviors from different parent
classes into a single subclass.

**File:** `task_04_flying_fish.py`

---

### 5. The Mystical Dragon - Mastering Mixins
Demonstrates the use of mixins to add reusable behavior to classes without
creating deep inheritance hierarchies.

**File:** `task_05_dragon.py`
